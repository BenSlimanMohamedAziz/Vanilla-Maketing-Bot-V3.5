                                        SPECIAL & IMPORTANT NOTES! :
                                        1. Generate EXACTLY the number of items matching the frequency.
                                        2. All content must reflect the brand tone: {company_data['brand_tone']}.
                                        3. IGNORE the current season entirely; do not mention seasons.
                                        4. IGNORE special events entirely; do not mention holidays, events, or observances.
                                        5. For video content, fill VIDEO_PLACEHOLDER with a clear **VIDEO GENERATION PROMPT** (no text/logo or company name), not a URL.
                                        6. For images, IMAGE_PROMPT must be a **simple, realistic prompt** (no text/logo or company name); keep it realistic and related to company industry.
                                        7. Note the content type for Facebook is (1 Video, 2 Text posts (status updates / announcements), and 3 Images Posts) [no stories]); For LinkedIn: ([2 videos a week, 1 Text Post, 2 Image Posts]); and for Instagram: include Reels (minimum 2 reels).
                                        8. When generating the HTML don't forget to add inside the h3 tag: (data-platform="Platform_name") like the Instagram example.
                                        9. Add Hidden style to the IMAGE_PROMPT, CAPTION, HASHTAGS and VIDEO_PLACEHOLDER.
                                        10. For each Platform, make BEST TIME & all Schedules non-identical across items; if days match, use different hours.
                                        11. For each Platform the description must be different from platform to platform.
                                        12. You may include website/phone in CTAs where natural (e.g., "📞 {company_data.get('phone','')}" or "🌐 {company_data.get('website','')}").
                                        13. Create CAPTIONS in the detailed professional format: Hook → Value (3-5 detailed bullet points) → CTA.
                                        14. Keep HASHTAGS separate from CAPTION in their own field.
                                        15. ALL schedule times must be in exact format: Day HourAM/PM (e.g., Thursday 9AM, Friday 3PM, Monday 12PM).
                                        16. CAPTIONS must be detailed, professional, and engaging - NOT short or truncated.
                                        17. IMAGE & VIDEO PROMPTS MUST be simple, realistic scenes - NO graphics, shapes, illustrations, or abstract concepts.
                                        18. ABSOLUTELY NO text or logos of any kind in image/video prompts.
                                        19. Focus on real people, objects, environments related to the company's industry.

        5. TREND-INTEGRATED: Use 2025 marketing trends practically **without** referencing seasons or events (e.g., short-form video, community-led content, AI-assisted workflows, UGC collaboration, educational carousels, value-first copy, social proof).
        6. IMAGE PROMPTS: Must be simple, realistic scenes (NO text/logo/graphics/shapes), aligned with the brand/theme and content idea.
        7. VIDEO PROMPTS: VIDEO_PLACEHOLDER content must be simple, realistic video prompts (NO text/logo/graphics/shapes), simple scenes aligned with platform and idea.

        - Return ONLY the HTML above. No extra explanations.
